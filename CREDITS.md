## Special Thanks

* __Cotton_Disciple__ (again) for their work being my inspiration to start this whole mess, as well as _sekrit dev stuff_
* __EmeraldCoasttt__ for Brutal Doom Platinum, answering my dumb questions, and just being overall awesome
* __Jekyll Grim Payne__ for confirming my suspicions that I was on the right path, because ACS can only do so much
* __Shockwave_S08__ for sharing their work as a reference, pointing out improvements, and finding weapon actors, correcting my stupidity, and generally just putting up with me
* __TonynUBares__ for wading through my ACS woes and implementation questions and showing me the token solution
